## 1. EVM

Ethereum 공식문서에 EVM에 대한 설명이 아주 잘 나와있어서 그대로 가져왔습니다.

> The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. All smart contracts and state changes on the Ethereum blockchain are executed by transactions. The EVM handles all of the transaction processing on the Ethereum network.
>
> As with any virtual machine, the EVM creates a level of abstraction between the executing code and the executing machine (an Ethereum node). Currently the EVM is running on thousands of nodes distributed across the world.
>
> Under the hood, the EVM uses a set of opcode instructions to execute specific tasks. These (140 unique) opcodes allow the EVM to be Turing-complete, which means the EVM is able to compute just about anything, given enough resources.
>
> As a dapp developer, you don't need to know much about the EVM other than it exists and that it reliably powers all applications on Ethereum without downtime. - [INTRODUCTION TO THE ETHEREUM STACK | Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/ethereum-stack/#ethereum-virtual-machine)
